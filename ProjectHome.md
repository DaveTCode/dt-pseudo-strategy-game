Primarily this project will act as a game engine for a new genre of pseudo turn based strategy games where both players take their turns at the same time and then the turns are resolved.

The secondary objective is to complete a playable multiplayer game based on that concept.

Additional aims include developing a computer player that is capable of playing the game with only the information that is available to a human player (Non-PI).
